## Learning Haskell

This repository contains basic code samples created as part of my journey to learn Haskell language.

These examples are inspired by the concepts introduced in the book ["Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!"](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) by Miran Lipovaca.


Haskell is a statically typed, purely functional programming language known for its concise syntax, type inference, and lazy evaluation.

You can download Haskell [Here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
