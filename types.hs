-- Type Declarations
type Name = String
-- declares a type Name which is a string 
type Tel = String
-- declares a type Tel which is a string

-- Declaring types using data keyword
data MyBtree = Node String MyBtree MyBtree 
               | Leaf String 
               | Empty

{-
MyBtree - is a type which is a Binary tree. the nodes are Strings
Constructors : -Node, Leaf, Empty 
 Node - contains the left and right trees
 Left - only one node which is a string
 Empty - no type as it's literally empty
